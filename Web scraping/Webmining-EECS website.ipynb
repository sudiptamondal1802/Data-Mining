    "The list of the various MSc programmes offered by the School of EECS is provided at the following URL: http://eecs.qmul.ac.uk/postgraduate/programmes/. Perform web scraping on the table present in the above URL and convert it into a pandas dataframe that would include one row for each programme of study as shown in the webpage. The dataframe should include the following 5 columns: name of postgraduate degree programme (e.g. Advanced Electronic and Electrical Engineering), programme code for part-time study (e.g. H60C), programme code for full-time study (e.g. H60A), URL for part-time study programme details, URL for full-time study programme details. Perform data cleaning to remove unnecessary characters when needed. In the report include the code that was used to scrape, convert and clean the table and provide evidence that the table has been successfully scraped (e.g. by displaying the contents of the dataframe)"
