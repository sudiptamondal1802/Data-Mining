# Data-Mining
There has been enormous amount of data generated every day by various industry and with the advent of technologies these petabytes and terabytes of data is generated and gathered which can be used for solving global challenges.
For instance, tracking number of Covid patients can be useful to avoid taking steps accordingly by the Governments, outlier detection is useful in identifying faluty machinery parts or even fraud detection from enormous amounts of daily transactions, predicting the impact of climate change based on the historical data and many such real world problems can be tackled if the data is mined and analysed.
Data mining is the key component for Data Science and in fact it was previously known as KDD (knowledge data discovery). The key steps in knowledge discovery are:
Data cleaning and integration
Data selection and transformation
Data mining
Pattern evaluation and presentation

In this repository, various stages are covered with Python programming with some useful libraries like Pandas and Numpy for data processing tasks, matplotlib, seaborn for the data visualization which forms the key to presentation.
Some machine learning methods have been covered as well for pattern recognition.
