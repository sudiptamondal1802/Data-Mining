# Data-Mining
There has been enormous amount of data generated every day by various industry and with the advent of technologies these petabytes and terabytes of data is generated and gathered which can be used for solving global challenges.
For instance, tracking number of Covid patients can be useful to avoid taking steps accordingly by the Governments, outlier detection is useful in identifying faluty machinery parts or even fraud detection from enormous amounts of daily transactions, predicting the impact of climate change based on the historical data and many such real world problems can be tackled if the data is mined and analysed.
These tasks can be either descriptive where we want to characterise the properties of the data in a target dataset like clustering data for market segmentation with unsupervised learning, document clsutering, building association rules for market basket analysis (like if a person is buying laptop he/she may be likely to buy microphones and headphones), anomay detection, derive patters. Descriptive tasks are exploratory in nature. The other task can be predictive where the data is used for making predictions (supervised learning with classification and regression).
Data mining is the key component for Data Science and in fact it was previously known as KDD (knowledge data discovery). The key steps in knowledge discovery are:
- Data cleaning and integration
- Data selection and transformation
- Pattern evaluation and presentation

In this repository, various stages are covered with Python programming with some useful libraries like Pandas and Numpy for data processing tasks, matplotlib, seaborn for the data visualization which forms the key to presentation.
Some machine learning methods have been covered as well for pattern recognition.


While mining the data we need to be careful that the mining is ethical and that it is being done only for the benefit of the society, avoid misuse of data, privacy-preserving so that personal data is not disclosed.
